39. Introduction to Mobile and Wireless Networks
================================================

WIRELESS NETWORKS ELEMENTS
--------------------------
Wireless hosts
Wireless links
Base stations
Network infrastructure


WIRELESS LINKS CHALLENGES
-------------------------
Decreasing signal strength
Interference from other sources
Multipath propagation
Signal-to-noise ratio






40. Wi-Fi
=========
Wi-Fi is a family of wireless network protocols, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access.


WIFI ELEMENTS
-------------
BSS - Basic Service Set
Access Point (AP)
SSID - Service Set Identifier
Wi-Fi jungle
Beacon frames
Passive scanning
Active scanning




41. Cellular networks
=====================


GSM
---
GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute to describe the protocols for second generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets.


GPRS
----
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system for mobile communications.


SMS messaging and broadcasting
"Always on" internet access
Multimedia messaging service (MMS)
Push-to-talk over cellular (PoC)
Internet applications for smart devices through wireless application protocol (WAP)
Point-to-point (P2P) service: inter networking with the Internet (IP)


ALL THE GS
----------

G1
• Designed exclusively for voiceonly communication.
• Almost extinct now.

G2
• Original 2G systems were also designed for voice, but later extended (2.5G) to support data.
• SMS and MMS

G3
• Voice + data, but with higher speed radio access links
• “Mobile broadband”
• Video calling

G4
• Increased speeds
• Higher quality video calls, gaming, streaming etc.
