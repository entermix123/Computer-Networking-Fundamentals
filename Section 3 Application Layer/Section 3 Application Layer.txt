10. Introduction of the Application Layer
=========================================

OSI Model:

	Layer			Information
	-----			-----------
1. L7	Application Layer	Message
2. L6	Presentation Layer	Message
3. L5	Session Layer		Message
4. L4	Transport Layer		Segment
5. L3	Network Layer		Packet and datagrams
6. L2	Data Link Layer		Frame
7. L1	Physical Layer		Bit


Application Layer:
- Ensures an application can effectively communicate with other applications on different computer systems and networks. 
- It is a components within an application that controls the communication method to other devices. It is an abstraction layer service that masks the rest of the application from the transmission process.

Functions:
- ensures that the receiving application is defined, reachable and ready to accept data
- when appropriate, enables authentication between devices for an extra layer of network security
- defines the types of messages exchanged, for example, request messages and response messages
- ensures agreement at both ends on error recovery procedures, data integrity and privacy
- determines protocol and data syntax rules at the application level
- present the data on the receiving end to the user application


Application Layer Protocols

Application			Protocol			Port				Underlying Transport Protocol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web				HTTP				80				TCP
File Tranfer			FTP				20, 21				TCP
Email				SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP		25/587, 110, 143		TCP
Remote Access			Telnet				23				TCP
Internet Telephony		SIR, RTP, Skype			5060, 5061, 16384-32767		UDP or TCP




11. P2P vs. Client-Server
=========================

12. HTTP
========
Hyper Text Transport Protocol defined in RFC1945 and RFC2616

HTTP is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program. The client program and server program, executing on different end systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP mesages.
HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and the server exchange the messages.


A WEB PAGE:
- A Web page consists if objects

- An object is simply a file - sucha s an HTML file, a JPEG image, a java applet or a video clip

- Most web pages consist of a base HTML file and several referenced objects

- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a an unique resource on the Web



THE URL
-------

http://www.udemy.com/course_x/test.docx
      |		    |                  |
	 hostname        object path


HTTP Responses
20x - OK
30x - redirect
40x - request error
50x - server error



13. HTTPS
=========

Hypertext Tranfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the HTTP.

It is combination of HTTP and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocols.


SSL and TLS
-----------
SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that encrypt and authenticate data transfer between servers, systems, applications and users.

TLS is latest and most used. SSL can be seen as naming of the certificates.



14. FTP
=======

FTP and HTTP/S both run on top of TCP.


FTP uses 2 parralel TCP channels.
	- control (commands) connection  - credentials, folders paths, etc	: port 21
	- data connection 		- tranfer only data			: port 20


FTP Commands:
	- User [username]: used to send the user identification to the server
	- Pass [password]: used to send the password for the user
	- LIST		 : used to ask the server to send back the list of all the files in the current folder 
			( the response of the request is send over the data connection port 20)
	- RETR [filename]: used to retreive a file 
			( the response of the request is send over the data connection port 20)
	- STOR [filename]: used to store file into the current directory of the remote host


FTP Replies:
	- 331 Username OK, password required
	- 125 Data connection already open, tranfer starting
	- 425 Can't open data connection
	- 452 Error writing file

There is a simplified version of FTP - TFTP:
	- Trivial File Transport Protocol
	- Uses UDP instead of TCP
	- Port number: 69
	- No authentication	
	- RFC 1350

	- Used in networks not exposed to the public internet (no authentication supproted - no fear of exploit)



15. E-mail
==========

W will go over 3 protocols:
	- SMTP
	- POP3
	- IMAP
	- Web mail


SMTP
----
Simple Mail Tranfer Protocol is defined in RFC 5321. SMTP tranfer messages from sednders' mail servers to the recipients' mail servers. Uses TCP and have server - client architecture.

Alice agent		Alice's mail		Bob's mail		Bob's agent
			 server			 server

--------- POP3, IMAP 	---------     SMTP	---------  POP3, IMAP	---------
|	|  --------->   |	|  --------->   |	|  --------->   |	|
---------	HTTP	---------		---------	HTTP	---------


POP3
----
Post Office Protocol V3
- RFC 1939
- Extremly simple (and limited in functionality)
- Port 110

IMAP
----
Internet Mail Access Protocol
- RFC 3501
- Solves biggest POP3 challanges - remote email server that can be accessed from other devices

HTTP
----
Web based - hyper text transfer protocol
- User agent is a web browser
- Mail servers still communicate via SMTP



16. DNS
=======

Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services and other resources on the internet.

DNS translates human readable domain names (for example, www.udemy.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example 104.16.66.85).


						 Web Client
						 ---------
						 |	 |
						 ---------
				DNS Request          ^
				from client	    / \
				to DNS server	   /   \	HTTP request  with the IP address taken from the DNS server
   					 	  /     \	from the client
				DNS responce	 /	 \	to the Web Server
				to		/ 	  \
				client	       /	   \	HTTP response with the web page data
					      v		    v
					---------	---------
					|	|	|	|
					---------	---------
					DNS Server	Web Server


DNS Tools
- nslookup nasa.gov
- ping nasa.gov

ipconfig /displaydns - show local dns cache
ipconfig /flushdns - empty local dns cache


17. Remote Access
=================

Use cases		- support connection in case of incidents that requires interventions
Telnet and ssh are tools for access devices via termianl 

Telnet				Not secure
------
- VTY - Virtual TeletYpe
- Uses TCP/port 23
- Client-Server protocol
- Support authentication but it is transfered in clear text!


SSH				Secure
---
- SSH - secure Shell
- Uses TCP/port 22
- Client-server protocol
- Encrypted authentication
- Encrypted data transfer


Practical Example
