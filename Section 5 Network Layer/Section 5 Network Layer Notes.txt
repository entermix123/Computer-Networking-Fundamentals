23. The Network Layer
=====================

Main network layer concerns
	- IP addresses
	- Routing



THE ROUTER
----------

A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.




24. The IP Address
==================

OSI Model
	Layer
	-----
1. L7	Application Layer	Processes
2. L6	Presentation Layer	Processes
3. L5	Session Layer		Processes
4. L4	Transport Layer		Port Number
5. L3	Network Layer		IP address		We focus on this layer IPs
6. L2	Data Link Layer		MAC address		physical address MACs
7. L1	Physical Layer		

IP - internet protocol is the internet layer - all other protocols on layer 1-3 exist to support the IP. IP address is unique numeric identifier.



25. Subnetting
==============

A subnet mask is a 32 bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s.

IP address "parts" example:

71 . 205 . 0 . 13
|           |    |
   network   host

Network Mask - A subnet mask is a 32 bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s.


Example 1
---------
71 . 205 . 0 . 13 /24
|           |    |    |
   network   host mask

01000111 . 11001101 . 00000000 . 00001101 - IP
1111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 . 00000000 - MASK
|			     |
	24 (summed, not binary sum) 


Example 2
---------
71 . 205 . 0 . 13 /16
|           |    |    |
   network   host mask

01000111 . 11001101 . 00000000 . 00001101 - IP
1111111 . 11111111 . 00000000 . 00000000 - MASK
|		   |
	16 (summed, not binary sum) 



We have 2 reserved addresses in this IP - 71.205.x.x

1. Netwrok ID Address
1111111 . 11111111 . 00000000 . 00000000 = 71.205.0.0

2. Broadcast IP - PC will use this IP for destination address for the data packets. All network participants will receive this packets from the broadcast IP address.

1111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 = 71.205.255.255

We can have IP that start with 255, but we can't have IP that start with 0 !




Quiz 1: Which IP is valid?
==========================

Question 1:
Which of the following IP addresses isn't a valid one?
1. 150.100.255.255
2. 200.200.200.200
3. 5.256.0.18		- invalid IP - 256 is above 255 range


Question 2:
Which of the following IP addresses isn't a valid one?
1. 0.34.5.189		- invalid IP - IP cannot start with 0
2. 192.168.1.1		
3. 1.0.0.0




26. DHCP
========

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used in computer networks for automatically  assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network.

DHCP uses a client server architecture.

DHCP Server can be just a service and not a physical PC. It can be configured on Routher (usually) or a PC.


How a PC is connected to the current network by the DHCP?

1. the PC send DHCP Discover (Broadcast) message
2. DHCP Server send DHCP Offer (Unicast) to the PC. Contains the PC network IP address (first available from the DHCP pool) and a set of IP parameters. 
3. The PC send DHCP Request (Broadcast) - the PC acknoledge the offer
4. DHCP server send DHCP Ack (Unicast) 	- DHCP server confirm the PC network settings




27. The Ping (ICMP)
===================

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues.

 Ping
 Traceroute
 Error reporting


TRACEROUTE
----------
• ICMP tool used to map the routing path
• Helps admins find link interruptions and other network issues
• Windows: “tracert”
• Linux MAC: “traceroute”
• Example: “tracert udemy.com”


PING
----
• The ping utility is a simpler traceroute
• It sends out pings (also referred to as echo request) and then measures the amount of time it takes the message to reach its destination and return to the source


ERROR REPORTING
---------------
• Implementation of the protocol to automatically check links and report on issues
• When traffic is dropped or rejected, it is common for network devices to send out ICMP messages containing details




SECURITY
--------
There are multiple ways an attacker can use ICMP to execute DDoS attacks, including the following:

 Ping of death - the hacker sends an IP packet larger than the number of bites allowed by the IP. When the receiver machine reassambles the packet, the size excedes the limit causing a buffer overflow and the receiving machine is frozen or crashes.

 Smurf - the hacker send ICMP packed with spoofed source IP address and the recipient send the wrong address a flood of packets. Working more on legacy/old equipment.

 ICMP flood (ping flood) - the hacker sends many requests to the receiver and cause the denail of the service of any other legitimate users.






28. NAT
=======

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping one or multiple private IP addresses to one public IP address.

0.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 = 232 = 4,294,967,296 - IPv4 total addresses - NAT is one of the solutions to reduce usage of public IP addresses.

PRIVATE VS. PUBLIC
------------------
• 10.0. 0.0 - 10.255. 255.255
• 172.16. 0.0 - 172.31. 255.255
• 192.168. 0.0 - 192.168. 255.255

We have public addresses (routers public IP addresses) amd privet addresses (local network IP addresses)




29. IPv6
========

0.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 = 232 = 4,294,967,296 - IPv4 total addresses

128 bits = 232 = 340 trillion trillion trillion - IPv6 total addresses

IPv6 format
-----------

Rule 1:
-------
Omit leading zeros in any group of 4 hexadecimal digits: the rule applies only to leading zeros and no trailing zeros. Even if a group consists of 4 zeros we can only omit the leading 3 - 0000.

Example 1:
2001:db8:1234::f3a0:22c6:f39c/64 - We have 8 groups by 4 bits. 

- Only the first zero ('0') can be removed for short.
- :: = 0000:0000

If an IPv6 address contains one or more consecutive groups of zeros, they can be replaced by a double colon (::)


2001:0db8:1234::f3a0:22c6:f39c/64
     |


Example 2:
2001:df8:f2::f11 - short IPv6 address

full IPv6 example 2:
2001:0df8:00f2:0000:0000:0000:0000:0f11


Rule 3:
------
Replacement of consecutive zeros can only be applied once, because otherwise, the original IPv6 address cannot be recreated from the shortened representation.

Example:
2001:8cbe:0000:0000:1fc2:0000:0000:f0b9

2001:8cbe::1fc2:0:0:f0b9 - VALID
         ||     | | 

2001:8cbe:0:0:1fc2::f0b9 - VALID
	  | |     ||

2001:8cbe::1fc2::f0b9	- NOT VALID !!!  We cannot have 2 '::' consecutive !




30. Routing
===========

STATIC - Used for small not scalable newtworks for manual administration - more secure from dynamic routing
------
• Relies on manual administrator configuration
• Un-scalable
• Prone to errors more so than routing protocols
• Fixed paths
• More secure


DYNAMIC - used in large scalable networks, consistent security attention needed
-------
• Uses routing protocols and algorithms
• Easier to configure (and scale)
• Easier to re-configure (or update) when needed
• Considers different paths at a given moment






31. Routing Protocol (IGP vs. EGP)
==================================

AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM
-----------------
An autonomous system (AS) is a very large network or group of networks with a single routing policy.


ROUTING PROTOCOLS
-----------------

INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING
• IGP – Interior Gateway Protocol
• Routing inside the autonomous system (AS)
• Usually a single routing policy
• RIP, OSPF, EIGRP + Static routing
	- Routomg Information Protocol
	- Open Shortest Path First
	- Enchanted Interior Gateway Routing Protocol



EXTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING
• EGP – Exterior Gateway Protocol
• Routing outside of ASs. In other words, routing between autonomous systems
• BGP
	- Border Gateway Protocol
